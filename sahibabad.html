                  Education is not just a process of giving knowledge for a
                  future job but a lifelong process which creates an
                  understanding of moral and ethical values to guide one’s life
                  in a right path. As a parent, you want the best for your child
                  and we are proud to be working with you to ensure that they
                  are given the right knowledge to face the future challenges.

                  school is situated in the rural background away from the
                  municipal limits of the city of Prayagraj. School strictly
                  follows the curriculum of CBSE without any deviation and gives
                  opportunity to the rural sections of the society residing
                  within the vicinity of the school. School thus provides ample
                  opportunity for cultural growth to the rural heart of
                  Prayagraj.
